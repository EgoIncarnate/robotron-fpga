=== Description ===

An FPGA implementation of the classic Robotron: 2084 video game. Both the
sound board and CPU/interface boards are implemented, but are in separate
sub-projects at the moment.

=== Requirements ===

- Digilent Nexys 2 Spartan-3E FPGA development board.
- Williams Robotron: 2084 ROM binaries, often named "robotron.s??".
- Python 2.6 to transform ROM file(s) into VHDL ROM blocks.
- Xilinx ISE WebPack 13.4 to compile VHDL and generate bit file.
- Digilent Adept or other JTAG tool to load bit file into device.
- VGA monitor.
- RC lowpass filter on the device's PWM audio output, or an eight-bit
  DAC attached to the 8-bit audio output pins of the device.

=== Tools ===

make_rom_file.py: translates a set of Robotron ROM board ROM files
    (like those you would use with the MAME arcade emulator) into a
    binary file that can be loaded into the flash device on the Digilent
    FPGA board.

make_decoder_vhdl.py: translates a decoder.4 or decoder.6 file (data
    dumped from decoder PROMs on the Robotron CPU board) into a VHDL
    file used by the robotron_cpu project.

dac_out_wave.py: translates the text file output of robotron_test.vhd
    into a WAV file that can be played.

make_sound_rom.py: produces rom_snd_blocks.vhd, containing VHDL ROM
    blocks, from the contents of a robotron.snd ROM file. The
    robotron.snd file is not provided due to copyright on the original
    ROM binaries produced by Williams. I happen to have a physical
    instance of the ROM board, so I'm in the clear. :-)

=== Notes ===

Please respect Williams Electronics' copyright and do not post any VHDL
or .bit files containing their binary code.
